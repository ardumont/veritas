# Paradox of rationality
"Paradox of rationality" describes the idea that the Prisoner's Dilemma (<c22f6b31>) embodies human
cooperation. However, as the Prisoner's Dilemma represents a situation which is constructed
precisely to limit cooperation, and therefore isn't reflective of normal situations where the
conditions for rational cooperation are present.

For example, Kant's claimed that rationality demanded obeying his "categorical imperative", and
therefore all rational players would choose to cooperate in the Prisoner's Dilemma given that this
choice would be best if all players chose it.
