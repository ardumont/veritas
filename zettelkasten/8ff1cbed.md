# Tagging as an archivist or a writer
In "How To Take Smart Notes", Ahrens contrasts two approaches to tagging notes - an archivist's
approach and a writer's approach. An archivist is described with some information should be kept,
whereas a writer is concerned with the situations where they'll need some information.

For example, in <2df9d388&cf>, I've tagged the note as `development-methodologies/agile`
(archivist's approach) and `misapplied-techniques` (writer's approach). When trying to find a
specific note about Agile, the archivist's approach will be most valuable; but when trying to find
surprising connections to other notes, the writer's approach will be most valuable.
