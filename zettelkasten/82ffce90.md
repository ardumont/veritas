# Feeling unease when going in the wrong direction
Often when writing code, I'll sometimes feel uneasy about whether I should continue with the current
task - the code is starting to feel *off*, as if something is wrong (such as a bad abstraction -
<53245735>). In speaking to colleagues, I know that this isn't isolated to just me - what
factors influence this feeling?

#### Unresolved questions
- Does working on a completely new project exacerbate this feeling because *nothing* is fixed yet?
  - Can structure help? <d8ec4ea5>
  - Can prioritizing something which works help? <2557e7cc>
- Does contributing to an existing project where you aren't in a position to make large changes
  help suppress this feeling?
