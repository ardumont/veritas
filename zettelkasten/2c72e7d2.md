# Matching Pennies
Matching Pennies is a simple game where coin is flipped - Alice wins if both coins have the
same face, and Bob wins otherwise.

| A / B         | B picks heads | B picks tails |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| A picks heads | +1 / -1       | -1 / +1       |
| A picks tails | -1 / +1       | +1 / -1       |

In <6ac72ae1?cf>, there is a similar game named "Driving Game" with "left" and "right" outcomes.
Matching Pennies is a zero-sum game (<f8ea81be?cf>).
