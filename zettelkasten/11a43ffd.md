# Expert beginners
In this blog post, Dietrich describes an informal extension to the <f949e0c1> to include an
"Expert Beginner" phase. It is argued that someone who is "Competent" or above in Dreyfus' model
has sufficient understanding of the big picture that they could not mistake themselves for an
"Expert". However, a "Advanced Beginner" could become a "Expert Beginner" who has mistaken their
skill level for that of an "Expert" - not knowing all that they do not know.

Furthermore, due to the nature of software engineering having long feedback cycles (e.g. the time
it takes to understand whether the trade-off inherent in an abstraction paid off), an "Advanced
Beginner" phase can last years in which time they have had promotions, job grades and pay rises
which can re-affirm the Dunning-Kruger effect. The author argues that peer review and interaction
with the larger software engineering community tend to prevent one becoming an "Expert Beginner".
