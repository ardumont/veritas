# Document outlines applied to software engineering
In "How To Take Smart Notes", Ahrens discusses how creating an outline of a document can help focus
attention on the content being written rather than the structure - knowing what you *don't have to
write*. This technique is similar to the approach in software engineering the top-level types and
functions are written before any of the functions are implemented. After an initial draft of the
top-level types and functions has been created - the outline - then the function implementation
can proceed without context-switching between the bigger picture and the work-at-hand. It's
important to avoid perfectionism in creating the outline (<2557e7cc>) - it can always be changed.
