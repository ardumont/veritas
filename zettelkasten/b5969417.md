# Mixed strategies
Mixed strategies involve randomizing choices of pure strategy. Consider <2c72e7d2>, randomizing
between heads and tails is a mixed strategy, which ends up being a Nash equilibrium (<e02e222e>).
Some mixed strategies do not involve utilizing each pure strategy equally often - e.g. in
<e0d2a73b>.

Intuitively, rational players would not alternate between strategies if one was less optimal.
However, if you believe your opponent will pick a mixed strategy that equalizes your average
payoff, then it makes more make sense (see <83de1c15>).
