# The Soul of a New Machine
After seeing the book recommended by [Bryan Cantrill][cantrill] and [Jessie Frazelle][frazelle],
I read "The Soul of a New Machine", by Tracy Kidder. Following which, I read both
[Bryan][cantrill_thoughts] and [Jessie][frazelle_thoughts]'s follow-up blog posts.

This is a really excellent book which does an incredible job at capturing what it means to be an
engineer motivated by solving hard problems. Below are notes inspired by my reading of the book.
