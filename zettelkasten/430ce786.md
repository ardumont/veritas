# Motivation from meaning/purpose
One of my major takeaways from reading [The Soul of a New Machine][soul] (<ee051404>) was that the
engineers were motivated by the meaning or purpose that came from building the Eagle - by building
the computer, they'd get to build the next generation too - they'd "stay in the game".

In reading (watching?) [Half-Life: Alyx - The Final Hours][alyx], I had a similar sense that proving
Valve were still capable of producing world-class games was a important motivational factor for
the engineers - which gave their work meaning or purpose - it was *important* in some meaningful
sense.

In both of these cases, there is an alignment of the individual goals and project goals
(<9bd56743>) - engineers at Valve wanted to prove that they were still capable and engineers at
Data General wanted to "stay in the game".

#### Unresolved questions
- Can there be meaning or purpose in a company which doesn't own its work?
