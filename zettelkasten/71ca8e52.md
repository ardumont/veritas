# Minimax theorem
The minimax theorem says that the rational solution of two-person, zero-sum games is to apply the
*maximin* principle. Zero-sum games are a special case where the minimax theorem makes sense.

Neumann's maximin principle says that you should determine the worst average payoff of your mixed
strategies and pick the strategy which would maximize payoff in the worst-case scenario.

The opposite is the minimax principle - choose the strategy which minimizes your payoff in
the best-case scenario. It isn't recommended.
