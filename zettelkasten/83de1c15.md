# Good Samaritan
Good Samaritan is played by an entire population of identical players, all of whom want to respond
to a cry for help. Each player gets ten utils if someone helps, nothing if nobody helps. All players
who help subtract one util from their payoffs.

The only <e02e222e> where everyone uses the same strategy is necessarily a mixed strategy
(<b5969417>).
