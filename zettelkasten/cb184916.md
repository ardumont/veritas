# Generations from garbage collection applied to codebases
In some garbage collectors, heaps are split into generations determined by how often the contents
are expected to live - longer-lived generations are searched less frequently, which improves
performance.

A similar idea could be applied to code in source control - splitting a codebase into
generations - which parts of a codebase have been seen the fewest refactors and has been the most
stable.

A technique like this could be a good empirical way of evaluating architectural choices (e.g.
determining whether creating an abstraction paid off - <53245735>).

#### Unresolved questions
- This must have been done before - where?
