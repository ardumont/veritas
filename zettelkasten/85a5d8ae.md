# Amdahl's Law

Amdahl's Law is a formula describing the relationship between the system's resources and the
theoretical speedup in task execution latency.

$$
S_{latency}(s) = \frac{1}{(1-p)+\frac{p}{s}}
$$

where,

- $S_{latency}(s)$ is the theoretical speedup of the entire task.
- $s$ is the speedup of the part of the task which benefits from improved resources.
- $p$ is the proportion of the execution time of the part of the task which benefits.
