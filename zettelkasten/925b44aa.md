# Chicken
Chicken is a game where Alice and Bob are two drivers approaching in a narrow street; if both
drivers go fast then they'll crash into each other; if one driver goes fast, then that driver will
have gotten to their destination faster; if both drivers go slowly, then they won't crash but will
have been delayed. Both drivers therefore have an interest in avoiding crashing.

| A / B           | B drives slowly | B drives fast   |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| A drives slowly | +3 / +3         | **+0** / **+4** |
| A drives fast   | **+4** / **+0** | -1 / -1         |

`(slow, speed)` and `(speed, slow)` are Nash equilibria (<e02e222e?cf>). In <6ac72ae1?cf>, there is
a similar game named "Battle of the Sexes".
