# Utility (Game Theory)
Utility is an abstract concept introduced in game theory to describe an actor's preference
towards an outcome (as it pertains to their goal or motivation, whatever that may be).

An actor's utility scale describes how much risk they would be willing to take in pursuit
of a preferential outcome (measured in *util*s). Behaviour can then be predicted in risky situations
by finding the choices which would produce the highest utility on average. <189c770c> describes
a method for determining utility.

Utility is a better measure than money or happiness as it can describe complex, multi-faceted aims
and is easy to measure, respectively.
