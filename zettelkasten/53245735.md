# Trade-offs in abstractions
Jesse Duffield writes about the trade-offs inherent in creating abstractions. Conventional wisdom
on abstraction comes from The Pragmatic Programmer in the DRY principle:

> Don't repeat yourself.

In the spirit of <2df9d388>, DRY seems unnuanced - expressed eloquently by Sandi Metz:

> Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction.

Duffield does an excellent job expressing the nature of an abstraction as a trade-off. When
abstracting, the engineer is placing a bet that the code was likely to converge (or remain
convergent) over time and changes in desired behaviour rather than diverge. In the convergent
case, the bet paid off and the code will be easier to maintain. In the divergent case, the
abstraction will make future changes more difficult.
