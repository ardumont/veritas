# Games (Game Theory)
<6ac72ae1?cf> introduces a ton of games while introducing concepts from game theory, this page
collects links to all of the games that I've come across in learning about game theory.

On most if not all pages, there will be a payoff table which describes the utility of each outcome
for each participant. Columns represent Bob's choice and rows represent Alice's choice. Within
a table cell, the left and right utils are Alice and Bob's utils respectively. When a player's
utility is in **bold** that indicates that - given knowledge of the other player's choice
(<7ca18c74>) - it is the best choice (for maximising utility). If both player's utility are in
**bold**, then that is a <e02e222e?cf>.
