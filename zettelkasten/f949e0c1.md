# Dreyfus' Model of Skill Acquisition
The Dreyfus brothers describe a model consisting of five phases that an individual progresses
through as they acquire skills in a discipline - "Novice", "Advanced Beginner", "Competent",
"Proficient" and "Expert". As an individual acquires more skills, they progress from having
"dogmatic rule-following and lack of understanding of the big picture" to having an "intuitive
transcending of rules and complete understanding of the big picture".

#### Unresolved tasks
- Read about Dreyfus' model in greater depth.
