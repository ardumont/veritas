# "Real experts don't make plans"
Ahrens discusses research which suggests that planning inhibits learning - following a strict plan
means that fewer decisions and mistakes will be made, and thus less learning will occur -
disrupting the path to expertise.

Experts are described as relying on "embodied experience" to reach a state of "virtuosity" -
utilizing an acquired intuition to progress a task (similar phenomena are described in <3fa9422f>).

> Gut feeling is [...] an incorporated history of experience.

Learning to ride a bicycle is used as an example - if you never took the training wheels off
(stopped using plans) then you'd never have learned to ride a bike (become an expert). Other
examples, such as the research of natural scientists and chess players are provided.

<f949e0c1> is referenced by this section, discussing that application of teachable rules can
only enable progress as far as the "Competent" phase.
