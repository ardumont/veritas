# Perfectionism in writing applied to software engineering
In writing, getting thoughts down on paper and then improving the prose is a much better approach
than being stuck trying to form the perfect sentence before writing anything. In this sense,
perfectionism is harmful as it interferes with getting the work done.

When writing software, the same idea can be applied - instead of getting caught up in using the
right algorithms, data structures and creating the most appropriate abstractions straight away -
focusing on building something that works first.
