# Rationality (Game Theory)
Game theory doesn't argue that some preferring some outcomes is more rational than others, but
says that any consistent behaviour is rational. Similarly, game theory does not try to explain
behaviour, instead focusing on description.

Acting consistently is thought to be the same as behaving in an effort to maximize the value of
*something* (e.g. if Alice is acting consistently, she is acting to maximize her <a3c2dd95>).
