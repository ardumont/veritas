# Prisoner's Dilemma
Prisoner's Dilemma is a game where Alice and Bob are gangsters who are guilty of a crime, the
district attorney offers a deal:

- If one actor confesses and the other does not, then the actor who confesses gets zero years
  in jail and the actor who does not will get a maximum sentence (10 years).
- If both actors confess then they get a shorter sentence (9 years).
- If neither actor confess then they get framed for a even shorter sentence (1 year).

Alice and Bob have agreed in advance to stay silent, so confessing amounts to betrayal, and staying
silent is cooperating.

| A / B                       | B betrays A (defects) | B stays silent (cooperates) |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| A betrays B (defects)       | **-9** / **-9**       | **0** / -10                 |
| A stays silent (cooperates) | -10 / **0**           | -1 / -1                     |

`(A betrays B, B betrays A)` is a Nash equilibria (<e02e222e?cf>). In <6ac72ae1?cf>, there is
a "give or take" variant presented.
