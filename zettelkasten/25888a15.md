# What are the minimal set of characteristics for a great software engineer?
In the [Unity 2020 proposal][unity2020], three characteristics are proposed which form a minimal
set of characteristics necessary for one to serve as US President:

- They must be patriotic
- They must be highly capable
- They must be courageous

What would the equivalent characteristics be of great software engineer - someone who could be an
"Expert" as in <f949e0c1>, have "embodied experience" or "transcendent intuition of the rules" as
in <3fa9422f>? Some capability for introspection and course-correction?
