# Selective pressure in software
Selective or evolutionary pressure in biology describes a reason why a member of a species would
have a benefit in survival for adopting (or no longer adopting) a trait. Selective pressures
influence natural selection - members of a population who do not survive will not pass on their
traits, so traits that are beneficial will spread when they lead to a member of the population
surviving.

For example, in populated areas, some rattlesnakes don't rattle - when humans hear a rattlesnake
then they'll kill the snake. As non-rattling snakes are less likely to be discovered, they will
survive to produce offspring which are less likely to rattle.

Some decisions made when building software can limit the growth of the software in unintuitive ways,
acting as selective pressures.

For example, rustc's codegen unit partitioning algorithm has a significant influences on which
optimisations are effective - an influence which isn't obvious. As optimisations which improve
compile-time performance are adopted (which means that those optimisations work well with the
current partitioning algorithm), changing the partitioning algorithm becomes more challenging as
everything which exists currently is biased towards the characteristics of the current algorithm.
