# Stories vs payoff tables
Stories which motivate each game aren't that important - the choices of the actors are based on
the payoff table, never the story. Empirically, this has held true, consider <c22f6b31> - in lab
experiments, after playing multiple games, only 10% of participants still choose to cooperate (this
rate is higher at the start).
