# Nash equilibrium
A Nash equilibrium describes an outcome when all players are making the best choice given knowledge
of the other player's choice. For example, in <925b44aa>, `(slow, speed)` and `(speed, slow)`
are Nash equilibria.

## Rational interpretation
Nash equilibria supposes that rational players use reason in determining the solution to a game and
that an evolutionary process of trial-and-error is used. In addition, Nash equilibria avoids
circular reasoning by acknowledging that any strategy will be redundant when players start
considering the strategy of other players.

## Evolutionary interpretation
Many evolutionary interpretations exist - in each, the "adjustment process" used by players to
reach an equilibrium differ. Simpler adjustment processes favour "fitter strategies" which only
cease to work when a Nash equilibrium is reached.
