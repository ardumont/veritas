# Prevalence-induced concept change
Levari et al. describe a phenomenon whereby humans respond to a decreased occurrence of a stimuli
by broadening what phenomena they would consider that stimuli. When dots varied on a spectrum from
blue to purple, and blue dots were made less common, then participants started considering purple
dots as blue.

#### Unresolved questions
- Could this relate to <86ae35ac?cf> - when time available becomes more prevalent, do we start
  considering more work relevant/related? (<4e3a4403?cf>?)
