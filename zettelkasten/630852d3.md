# Switch
Before my final exams in 2020, I read "Switch: How to change things when change is hard" by Chip
Heath and Dan Heath after seeing it recommended on [Jessie Frazelle's blog][jess].

In their book, they describe two different aspects of human motivation - rational and emotional -
and describe techniques for influencing those in others, with lessons drawn from a series of
real-world examples.

Chip & Dan use an analogy from Jonathan Haidt, describing our emotional side as an elephant and
rational side as its rider. Both have strengths - the rider provides planning and direction and the
elephant provides the energy.

Techniques are split into three categories - motivating the rational side, the emotional side and
making change easier.

**Rational:**

- Research what works and mirror it.
- Script the critical steps.
- Focus on the destination and why that's worthwhile.

**Emotional:**

- Find a way to make people emotionally invested.
- Make the change small enough that it isn't frightening.
- Encourage an identity

**Environmental:**

- Change the situation so that the behaviour has to follow.
- Find ways to encourage habits.
- Get some people involved and others will follow.

There are lots of great tips at the end of the book (~Pg 260) which are worth re-visiting
regularly.
