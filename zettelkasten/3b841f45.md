# Risk (Game Theory)
Risk describes the likelihood of an actor performing an action depending on how they perceive the
potential positives and negatives of doing so. Risk is related to utility (<a3c2dd95>) in that
utility influences our willingness to take risk (e.g. what utility will I get from taking this
action?) and in determining utility.

Economics regard risk aversion as a personal preference and some philosophers consider it rational
to be risk averse when defending against an alternative to their preferred outcome which maximises
utility. An actor's attitude to risk is accounted for by the method for determining utility
described in <189c770c>.
