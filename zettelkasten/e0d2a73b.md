# Battle of the Sexes
Battle of the Sexes is game involving a married couple deciding between going to a boxing match
or a ballet; Bob prefers the boxing match and Alice prefers the ballet. Alice and Bob are separated
and have to decide where to go - if they end up at different events then they get zero utils.

| A / B            | B attends ball | B attends boxing |
|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| A attends ball   | **2** / **1**  | 0 / 0            |
| A attends boxing | 0 / 0          | **1** / **2**    |
