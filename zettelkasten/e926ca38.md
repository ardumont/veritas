# Ego depletion
Ego depletion describes the temporary state of having less energy to make decisions, start
working on things and control oneself - anything voluntary that would be thought of as requiring
willpower. While ego depletion is primarily a result of having previously performed voluntary
activities, there's (admittedly contested) research to suggest that unrelated environmental effects
can impact ego depletion.
