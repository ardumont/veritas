# Determining utility
To determine how much <a3c2dd95?cf> to assign to an outcome, take the worst and best outcomes and
assign them a quantity of utils (e.g. 0 and 100 utils, respectively). Next, imagine an event which
upon participating will result in either the best or worst outcome depending on some probability.
When that probability reaches a threshold such that an actor chooses to participate, then that
is the number of utils assigned to the event.

In many games, there are finite outcomes - e.g. win and lose - which can be assigned arbitrary
utility - e.g. -1 and 1.
