# Write down criticisms
Charles Darwin forced himself to write and explain arguments most critical of his theories:

> I had [...] during many years followed a golden rule, namely, that whenever a published fact, a
> new observation or thought came across me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a
> memorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by experience that such facts and
> thoughts were apt to escape from the memory than favorable ones. Owning to this habit, very few
> objections were raised against my views, which I had not at least noticed at attempted to answer.

By making a note of every objection, you are forced to consider arguments against your ideas and
make corrections or form arguments.
