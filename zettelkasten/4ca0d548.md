# How To Take Smart Notes
Before starting this Zettelkasten, I read the book "How To Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique
To Boost Writing, Learning And Thinking" by SÃ¶nke Ahrens which is often recommended by blog posts
which aim to introduce the reader to Zettelkasten. This page collects the notes which were
synthesized from my reading of the book.
