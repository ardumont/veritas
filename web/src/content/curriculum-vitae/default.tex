\textbf{Rust Programming Language} \\
\textit{Compiler Team Contributor} \hfill {\color{gray} Oct 2017 - Present} \\
\vspace{2mm}
I’m a regular contributor to the rustc, the Rust compiler. Currently, I'm a member of the
non-lexical lifetimes (NLL), async/await and diagnostics working groups, and a co-lead of the
polymorphisation and meta working groups. Amongst my most notable contributions, I've implemented
the non-exhaustive attribute from RFC 2008, and polymorphisation, a code-size and compile-time
optimisation which reduces unnecessary monomorphisation.

\textbf{Codeplay Software Ltd.} \hfill {\color{gray} Edinburgh, Scotland} \\
\textit{Integrations Engineer} \hfill {\color{gray} Sep 2017 - Present} \\
\vspace{2mm}
At Codeplay, I'm the primary maintainer of the continuous integration infrastructure and lead
the effort to rebuild the core infrastructure with NixOps to improve reproducibility. \\
\vspace{2mm}
Within this effort, I'm responsible for providing technical leadership on ..., and in addition,
mentoring colleagues and creating internal resources to teach new technologies, such as Nix, within
the infrastructure team. For example, a container-based learning environment when enables
experimentation with NixOS was developed alongside documentation for a guided introduction.
Furthermore, I maintain a handful of internal tools, both for use within the infrastructure team
and in engineering teams. \\
\vspace{2mm}
In addition, I've been a compiler engineer at Codeplay on customer projects working with LLVM,
Clang, SPIR-V and NVPTX.

\textbf{Scottish Engineering} \hfill {\color{gray} Glasgow, Scotland} \\
\textit{Software Consultant} \hfill {\color{gray} Sep 2018 - Nov 2018} \\
\vspace{2mm}
Following the success of previous work with Polaroid Eyewear and West Dunbartonshire Leisure, I
was contracted to work on a data analysis tool for Scottish Engineering which enabled summarization
and filtering of yearly survey results. Working with stakeholders from Scottish Engineering and
understanding their business requirements was essential before designing an appropriate solution.

\textit{Intern Build Engineer} \hfill {\color{gray} May 2017 - Sep 2017} \\
\vspace{2mm}
During a summer, I rebuilt the entirety of Codeplay's continuous integration infrastructure
in my internship - introducing automated re-provisioning of Ubuntu, CentOS and Windows build nodes
and improving the configuration management, vastly reducing the turn-around time of changes
requested by engineering teams and downtime which impacted engineering team productivity. In
addition, I made various improvements to internal tools relied on by engineering teams.

\textbf{West Dunbartonshire Leisure} \hfill {\color{gray} Alexandria, Scotland} \\
\textit{Software Consultant} \hfill {\color{gray} Apr 2015 - Feb 2017} \\
\vspace{2mm}
Following my work with Polaroid Eyewear on their 10K Race Series website, I worked closely with
West Dunbartonshire Leisure to create a landing page for their 10K race series - a continuation of
Polaroid Eyewear’s series. After consultation with the team at West Dunbartonshire Leisure to
understand their requirements, I built a functional, easy-to-use and easy-to-update website which
requires very little maintenance and launched to great user feedback in February, 2017.

\textbf{Polaroid Eyewear} \hfill {\color{gray} Dumbarton, Scotland} \\
\textit{Software Consultant} \hfill {\color{gray} Jun 2014 - Jun 2016} \\
\vspace{2mm}
Polaroid Eyewear contracted me to build a shop floor information system - MIDAS - an ASP.NET
system which is the backbone of Polaroid Eyewear's lens manufacturing. Working within the structure
of the IT team, I worked closely with the final users to define new features and enhancements.
MIDAS went live in September, 2014 to excellent user feedback. \\
\vspace{2mm}
During the summer of 2015, I built and designed a fully-featured web-based Inventory Manager system
and a suite of desktop applications for tracking the performance of the Warehouse. Both projects
required independence and coordination with other departments and employees. These well-designed
applications released on schedule with brilliant feedback from users. \\
\vspace{2mm}
Following the success of MIDAS, I worked on creating an updated, modern website for Polaroid
Eyewear's 10K Race Series - the e-commerce website allowed runners to enter any of the four races
in the series and be assigned and shipped their race number. After launching the new website to
great feedback, the series saw an incease in runners, charitable donations and saved money on
payment processing costs.

\textbf{University of Glasgow} \hfill {\color{gray} Glasgow, Scotland} \\
\textit{MSci Software Engineering with Work Placement, Honours of the First Class} \hfill {\color{gray} Sep 2015 - Jun 2020} \\
\vspace{2mm}
I graduated with a GPA of 20.0 and completed my Master's Project on ``Polymorphisation''
\footnotemark[1], an code-size optimisation in the Rust compiler to reduce unnecessary
monomorphisation during code generation. \\
\vspace{2mm}
In my second year, I led a team which developed a domain-specific continuous integration platform
in Python for testing coursework of ``Web App Development 2''. Docker containers were dynamically
provisioned which ran testing on student-provided Git repositories containing their coursework. \\
\vspace{2mm}
Similarly, in my third year, I worked in a team tasked with creating a event-sourced financial
platform \footnotemark[2] \footnotemark[3] for Avaloq, a banking software company. For the duration
of the project, I managed and led development on the event bus and the ``superclient''. Both written
in Rust, the event bus is the central server that manages and persists events while ensuring
consistency, correlation and horizontal scaling of microservice clients; the superclient is a
framework for building client applications in Lua with persistence and exposing a REST API. \\
\vspace{2mm}
Additionally, this involved working with the team to design and implement the various solutions that
allowed the system to achieve the desired properties; to streamline and improve our development
processes; and to mentor other team members in fixing bugs and building features when working with
unfamiliar technologies.

\textit{Nuffield Foundation Placement} \hfill {\color{gray} May 2014 - July 2014} \\
\vspace{2mm}
While on a summer placement at Glasgow Caledonian University, I implemented a colour-based
tracking algorithm from a research paper in C++ with OpenCV \footnotemark[4] \footnotemark[5] which
was capable of full 360 tracking of multiple objects simultaneously including when the object
leaves and re-enters the frame. \\
\vspace{2mm}
Furthermore, I built a tool for non-photorealistic rendering using OpenCV to make an image look
less realistic - in essence, creating a cartoon out of an image. Images were processed in two
distinct stages - extracting the edges from the image and overlaying them on a copy of the
original image that uses a reduced set of colours.
